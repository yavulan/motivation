# High quality

Doing moderate quality may be faster, especially on short-term projects. But it steals an opportunity to feel good about yourself and ruins positive reinforcement.

In any situation try to do your best. It makes possible to love the result of your work .

## Workflow example

_Do a research on existing solutions of stuff you are doing =&gt;  
Find flaws in those decisions =&gt; Make your decision better \(even just a little better\) =&gt;  
Feel good about yourself. _[ðŸ˜¤](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#emoji-modal)
