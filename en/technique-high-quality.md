# High quality

Doing moderate quality may be faster, especially on short-term projects. But it steals an opportunity to feel good about yourself and ruins positive reinforcement.

In any situation try to do your best. It makes possible to love your work result.

## Workflow example

*See some other living examples on the Internet of stuff you are doing =>
Find flaws in those decisions and make your decision better (even just a little better) =>
Feel good about yourself.*
