# Take care of health

Live a life and try to maintain yourself healthy.

* Eat healthy, drink enough water
* Sleep healthy
* Do workout
* Remember to take a rest and to relax
* Do your hobbies and side projects
* Meet people

Also, you may want to try some kind of *meditation* (we already tried some simplest adaptation in [Do nothing](technique-do-nothing.md) chapter).
