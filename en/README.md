# Motivation uncovered

I found myself skipping majority of introductions when reading books, so let's have a fast start.

This book will provide some thoughts on motivation process. Mainly it covers freelance experience, but, you know, be creative, use it widely.

# Brief intro

Being a freelancer gives your a freedom. But that freedom comes with necessity to repetitively resolve motivation issues.
It is useful to consider working on your motivation as a part of your occupation.

Material motivation doesn't work the way we expect it to works (it is not linear in a long-term and we adapt quickly to the rise of income).
So, we'll skip all material kinds of motivation.

# Written

As a kind of self-experiment and for freelancers from all over the world.

# Goals

To be honest, sharp, and short without making a piece of another marketing sh*t out of this topic.
