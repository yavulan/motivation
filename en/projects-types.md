# Project types

Besides of the projects you will like, there would be some amount of “stuck” projects.

**“Stuck” project** - project that constantly makes you let down. You will find yourself trying to do anything else except of this project (like me writing this text instead of working on current project).

## Be aware

Avoid self-destructing traps:

* Avoid cyclically thinking that you are doing bad on this project - it's absolutely normal to slow things down on this kind of a project.
* Avoid changing your mind to “I have to get rid of this by finishing it as fast as I can” - though it may be productive on small projects, it fizzles out fast and leads to bad quality decisions. Also, it ties your motivation to the finish of a project, and in case the project is not small you will find yourself stuck.

## What to do

* [Love the project](technique-love-the-project.md)
* [Resolve misunderstandings](technique-resolve-misunderstanding.md)
