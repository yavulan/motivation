# Learn yourself

People are different, so the magic motivation solution do not exist.

Become an expert in yourself.

* What technique is helpful for you and what is not
* How your procrastination adapts to the new techniques and what you can do about it
* Do a brief summary on dealing with motivation decisions at the end of a day
