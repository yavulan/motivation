# Learn yourself

People are different, so the magic motivation solution does not exist.

Become an expert in yourself. Do a brief summary on dealing with motivation decisions at the end of a day.

## Figure out
* What techniques are helpful for you and what aren't
* How your procrastination adapts to the new techniques and what you can do about it
