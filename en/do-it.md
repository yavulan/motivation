# Do it

By now, we tried to fill a gap between facing motivation issues and understanding them. And we did it honestly, sharply, and shortly.

Filling the gap between the understanding and repetitive solving of that issue is up to you.

That's right. Now you know things. And it's yours decisions. Use it or lose it.

Be passionate. Be creative. Have fun.
